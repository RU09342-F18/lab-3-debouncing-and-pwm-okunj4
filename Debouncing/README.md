# Software Debouncing
The mechanical switches on the board sometimes "bounce" which is when they actuate more than once in a single press.  This can be seen and when you press the button once it will do what it's supposed to do more than once.  In this lab the following codes are for the MSP430G2553, and the MSP430FR2311.  Debouncing is done to fix the issue of bouncing.  In this part of the lab it was done by writing code that only allows the register a single input per press.  This is done using the timer modules on both boards.  An oscilloscope helped determine the period that the button bounces at which was determined to be 10ms.
## MSP430G2553
The code for the debouncing on the MSP430G2553 enables debouncing for the button on P1.3.  When the button is pressed the LED on P1.6 will light up and turn off when pressed again.  The button is prevented from bouncing and turning the LED on or off when it isn't wanted.
## MSP430FR2311
The process of debouncing on the MSP430FR2311 is similar to how it is done on the G2.  Different ports are used and some syntax changes due to different timers and registers on the FR2311.  The code for the FR2311 utilizes the button on P1.1 and the LED that turns on and off is on P1.0
