# Software PWM
For this part of lab 3, the LED is incremented in steps of 10% by the press of a button.  This is done by changing the duty cycle using a software loop.  The current duty cycle of the LED is detected using an if statement.  If the duty cycle isn't at 100% brightness it will be incremented by another 10%.  Once the duty cycle reaches 100% it is reset to 0% and the process goes again.
## Implementation for both boards
the implementation of software PWM for both boards is pretty much the same.  The part that is changed is the port numbers for the buttons and LEDs.  Timer A0 is used to set the duty cylce to 100% limit, and Timer A1 is used to debounce the button so no bouncing occurs.  When the brightness of the LED is increased, another LED lights up to show the button has been pressed to increment the LED's brightness.
